Enterprise Third-Party & Vendor Risk Assessment
Aligned with NIST SP 800-161 & ISO 27001 Principles

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise third-party cybersecurity risk assessment. The objective was to evaluate how an organization manages cybersecurity risks introduced by vendors and suppliers, identify gaps, and design a structured Vendor Risk Management (VRM) program aligned with industry standards.
The assessment focuses on reducing supply-chain risk while ensuring business operations remain secure, resilient, and compliant.

🏢 Organization Profile (Mock)
* Organization Name: Cypronetics
* Industry: Technology / SaaS
* Environment: Cloud-based infrastructure with multiple third-party vendors
* Vendor Types: Cloud service provider, HR platform, payment processor, IT support services

🎯 Project Objectives
* Identify cybersecurity risks introduced by third-party vendors
* Assess vendor access to systems and sensitive data
* Evaluate onboarding, monitoring, and incident response practices
* Develop a scalable vendor risk management framework
* Align vendor security controls with business risk tolerance

📚 Frameworks & Standards Used
* NIST SP 800-161 – Supply Chain Risk Management
* ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A) – Information Security Controls
* CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

🔍 Assessment Scope & Methodology
The assessment was conducted across five key domains:
1️⃣ Vendor Inventory & Risk Classification
* Identified all third-party vendors
* Classified vendors based on:
    * Data sensitivity
    * Level of system access
    * Business criticality
Purpose: Prioritize security efforts based on risk impact.

2️⃣ Vendor Onboarding & Due Diligence
Reviewed whether vendors were:
* Assessed using security questionnaires
* Required to meet minimum security standards
* Contractually obligated to follow cybersecurity requirements
Finding: Vendor onboarding lacked consistency and formal security validation.

3️⃣ Access Control & Data Handling
Evaluated:
* Least privilege enforcement
* Vendor access review processes
* Data encryption and protection requirements
Risk Identified: Excessive vendor access and limited visibility into data handling practices.

4️⃣ Monitoring & Incident Response
Assessed:
* Vendor activity logging and monitoring
* Breach notification timelines
* Incident response responsibilities
Gap: No formal vendor incident response or breach escalation procedures.

5️⃣ Risk Scoring & Reporting
Developed:
* Vendor risk tiers (Low / Medium / High)
* Executive-friendly risk summaries
* Remediation tracking and accountability

📊 Key Findings
* High-risk vendors were not formally assessed
* Vendor access reviews were not conducted regularly
* Incident notification requirements were unclear
* Supply-chain risk was not integrated into enterprise risk reporting

🛠️ Recommendations & Roadmap
Short-Term (0–90 Days)
* Create standardized vendor security questionnaires
* Classify vendors by risk level
* Enforce least-privilege access controls
Mid-Term (3–6 Months)
* Add cybersecurity clauses to vendor contracts
* Establish breach notification SLAs
* Perform annual vendor security reviews
Long-Term (6–12 Months)
* Implement continuous vendor risk monitoring
* Integrate vendor risk into the enterprise risk register
* Provide executive-level vendor risk reporting

🔐 CIA Triad Alignment
