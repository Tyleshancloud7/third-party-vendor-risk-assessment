# third-party-vendor-risk-assessment 
Enterprise Third-Party & Vendor Risk Assessment
Aligned with NIST SP 800-161 & ISO 27001 Principles

Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world enterprise third-party cybersecurity risk assessment. The objective was to evaluate how an organization manages cybersecurity risks introduced by vendors and suppliers, identify gaps, and design a structured Vendor Risk Management (VRM) program aligned with industry standards.
The assessment focuses on reducing supply-chain risk while ensuring business operations remain secure, resilient, and compliant.

* Organization Name: Cypronetics
* Industry: Technology / SaaS
* Environment: Cloud-based infrastructure with multiple third-party vendors
* Vendor Types: Cloud service provider, HR platform, payment processor, IT support services

Project Objectives
* Identify cybersecurity risks introduced by third-party vendors
* Assess vendor access to systems and sensitive data
* Evaluate onboarding, monitoring, and incident response practices
* Develop a scalable vendor risk management framework
* Align vendor security controls with business risk tolerance

Frameworks & Standards Used
* NIST SP 800-161 – Supply Chain Risk Management
* ISO/IEC 27001 (Annex A) – Information Security Controls
* CIA Triad – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability

 Assessment Scope & Methodology
The assessment was conducted across five key domains:
1️⃣ Vendor Inventory & Risk Classification
* Identified all third-party vendors
* Classified vendors based on:
    * Data sensitivity
    * Level of system access
    * Business criticality
Purpose: Prioritize security efforts based on risk impact.

2️⃣ Vendor Onboarding & Due Diligence
Reviewed whether vendors were:
* Assessed using security questionnaires
* Required to meet minimum security standards
* Contractually obligated to follow cybersecurity requirements
Finding: Vendor onboarding lacked consistency and formal security validation.

3️⃣ Access Control & Data Handling
Evaluated:
* Least privilege enforcement
* Vendor access review processes
* Data encryption and protection requirements
Risk Identified: Excessive vendor access and limited visibility into data handling practices.

4️⃣ Monitoring & Incident Response
Assessed:
* Vendor activity logging and monitoring
* Breach notification timelines
* Incident response responsibilities
Gap: No formal vendor incident response or breach escalation procedures.

5️⃣ Risk Scoring & Reporting
Developed:
* Vendor risk tiers (Low / Medium / High)
* Executive-friendly risk summaries
* Remediation tracking and accountability

 Key Findings
* High-risk vendors were not formally assessed
* Vendor access reviews were not conducted regularly
* Incident notification requirements were unclear
* Supply-chain risk was not integrated into enterprise risk reporting

 Recommendations & Roadmap
Short-Term (0–90 Days)
* Create standardized vendor security questionnaires
* Classify vendors by risk level
* Enforce least-privilege access controls
Mid-Term (3–6 Months)
* Add cybersecurity clauses to vendor contracts
* Establish breach notification SLAs
* Perform annual vendor security reviews
Long-Term (6–12 Months)
* Implement continuous vendor risk monitoring
* Integrate vendor risk into the enterprise risk register
* Provide executive-level vendor risk reporting

🔐 CIA Triad Alignment
Security Principle	Implementation
Confidentiality	Access restrictions, encryption requirements
Integrity	Audit logging, change management
Availability	Vendor resilience planning and recovery processes
  Business Value
This project demonstrates how structured vendor risk management:
* Reduces exposure to supply-chain attacks
* Improves regulatory readiness
* Aligns cybersecurity with business objectives
* Enhances executive decisions.
